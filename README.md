## INTRO I filtered information about cities by their types suburbanas, urbans, or rural to see how that affected taxi fares. I created many dataframes in Jupyter Notebooks and used Matplotlib. ##

## CONCLUSION  Urban cities had the highest fares, the most drivers, and the most profits for drivers. Which data frames and pivot tables allowed me to filter down and see. ##
